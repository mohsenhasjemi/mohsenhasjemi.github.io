## Exploring Data-Driven Solutions

I am a data professional with a background in industrial engineering, currently focusing on data science and digital transformation. My goal is to create data-driven solutions that drive innovation and efficiency.

## Experience

I have experience as a Linguistic Data Analyst at the [Academy of Persian Language and Literature](https://apll.ir/), where I worked with extensive terminological datasets to enhance workflow efficiency. As a Terminology Expert at the [Research Center of Terminology Studies](https://apll.ir/rcts/), I supported research and decision-making through data-driven approaches in terminology management.

Additionally, I have worked as an editor at [Goman Publication](https://gomanbook.com/), contributing to various translations and publications. As the Chief Operating Officer at [Lahn-e Digar](https://www.instagram.com/lahnedigar/), I led operations, implemented Scrum methodology, and established a recording studio for high-quality audiobook production.
