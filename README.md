I am a data professional with a background in industrial engineering, currently focusing on data science and digital transformation. My goal is to create data-driven solutions that drive innovation and efficiency.

I have experience as a Linguistic Data Analyst at the [Academy of Persian Language and Literature](https://apll.ir/), where I worked with extensive terminological datasets to enhance workflow efficiency. As a Terminology Expert at the [Research Center of Terminology Studies](https://apll.ir/rcts/), I supported research and decision-making through data-driven approaches in terminology management.

Additionally, I have worked as an editor at [Goman Publication](https://gomanbook.com/), contributing to various translations and publications. As the Chief Operating Officer at [Lahn-e Digar](https://www.instagram.com/lahnedigar/), I led operations, implemented Scrum methodology, and established a recording studio for high-quality audiobook production.


## Education
- **MA in Terminology, [RCTS](https://apll.ir/rcts/)** <br>
September 2016 - September 2020 <br>
The academic focus closely parallels Linguistics programs. Guided by [Mohammad Dabir-Moghaddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Dabir_Moghaddam), I completed a Master's thesis delving into the intricate analysis of modality and polarity systems in Persian scientific discourse, utilizing systemic functional grammar as the analytical lens.

- **BS in Industrial Engineering, [KIAU](https://karaj.iau.ir/en)** <br>
September 2010 - October 2015 <br>
My studies have covered a diverse range of topics including operations research, production planning and control, quality management, probability theory, and statistical analysis.
